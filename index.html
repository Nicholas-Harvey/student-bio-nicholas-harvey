      <p>Hi how is it going? My name is Nicholas and I live in Denver, Colorado. I am a student at the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp for Web Development and I am very excited to start coding as a career!
      Prior to joing this coding bootcamp I have been working for the past three years in the food service indusrty. For half of that time I was the manager of the catering department at Stonybrook University, now I am a staff member at the University of Denver. That was a pretty bit career change, but this will be too so whatever, right?</p>
